# North Track

This project is a web application that allows one to track goals. It might track your goals toward some technology you are studying,
or it might be something else like tracking your progress on sports or any other activities.

I created this project mainly because I wanted to:
- practice what I'm learning about React
- having a custom solution for me to track my own goals

The following image shows a bit about how this app should look like while it's being developed:

## Running the application

In the project directory, you can run: `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing the application 
`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Building the app for production
`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
